Engineered a semantic segmentation model for land cover analysis using PyTorch, leveraging deep learning to enhance environmental data interpretation and decision-making

This project focuses on semantic segmentation for land cover classification using PyTorch. The goal is to classify different land cover types (e.g., forest, water, urban areas, etc.) from satellite or aerial imagery, which can be used in environmental monitoring, urban planning, agriculture, and many other applications.
